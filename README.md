Those are all quite empty still so don't get too excited yet.

I'm still kinda winging it here and haven't set out to write this much stuff ever, so it's gonna get interesting. I hope to provide some useful info, let me know if helps you out in anyway. Also let me know if I've done something just plain dumb or incorrect. Usually it's easy to spot when you're not doing something right, sometimes it just doesn't matter though.

This repo will be the place providing additional details about how and why all the things listed above are tied together.

### Caveats and things to keep in mind:
- Understand that all this started with the primary audience consisting of me, and me alone. This means not all decisions I make will apply or make sense for everyone. I won't purposely make things difficult, but some things may not make sense to some people.
- I am open to anything you think would be an improvement so yes, pull requests, issues, general discussions are welcome.
- I'll try to note when I do something that seems wrong or just doesn't feel right and correct course accordingly.
- Everything here has been done on a MacbookPro M1 Max with 32GB of memory. I haven't run into any performance issues even with 10+ containers running, Chrome (40+ tabs), Firefox(usually not more than 8 or so tabs), and Brave (40+ tabs, all Youtube) running.
- As of now, all apps are built on plain old Docker along with the Docker Desktop app. I've briefly looked at some of the Docker alternatives but nothing was compelling enough to make a switch. Convince me otherwise!
- As far as containers go, I try to start with an Alpine image, but the moment something becomes an issue and it appears to be related to Alpine, I don't hesitate for a second to switch to a Bookworm (or whatever else is appropriate) based image. It's good to branch out anyway.

### Usage of AI:
- Unless explicitly noted, I haven't used AI for anything here. That's probably not 100% true, but it provides the gist of the idea.
- I don't have anything against it really and it has it's place for some tasks, especially if time is a major factor.
- Personally, I like the whole process of trial and error, reading the docs, and deciding all the minutiae of building things. Crazy, I know.
- Coding by typing into a prompt and copy/pasting things just doesn't appeal to me at all. If you're paying me to do something, then that's a different story.
